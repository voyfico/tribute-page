                In 2019 to mark the 30th anniversary of the world wide web <br> Tim Berners-Lee spoke to TIME about his role in sparking our new information age and explains his optimism about the future
            </h3>
        </section>
        <section>
            <div class="time">
                <p>The amount of data that is now generated can allow programmers to predict our behavior. Are you worried that information can be used to influence us in ways that we don’t understand?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timBernersLee">
                <p>I’ve got a vision for an alternative world, in which that data does exist, but it’s at the beck and call of the user themselves. Where the apps are actually separated from the data source. So when you use an app, it asks, where do you want me to store the data? And you have complete control over who gets access to it. It would be a new world. We’re talking about a future in which these programs work for you. They don’t work for Amazon, they don’t work for Apple.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="time">
                <p>You’ve been very vocal about ensuring that the Internet is open to all. But only some 50% of the people in the world are online. Despite that, obviously the Internet has fundamentally changed our world. Do you see a change of similar magnitude when the other half of humanity comes online?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timBernersLee">
                <p>I do. I think it will be really amazing to watch. There’s a dominance on the current web of rich white males. Women and minority races are not as well represented. My guess is we’ll see great richness from different indigenous communities, for example. We’ll see different people whose governments work in different ways on board. Maybe we’ll have very effective new automatic translation that will give us windows into other cultures, which we don’t currently have. It’s very exciting.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="time">
                <p>When you envisioned the world wide web for the first time 30 years ago, did you have any sense of the impact that it would have?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timBernersLee">
                <p>I didn’t. We didn’t even know that it would work. To some extent, there are still things that can go wrong with it, and we shouldn’t take it for granted.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="time">
                <p>Did you predict the problems we currently see, like disinformation and trolling?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timBernersLee">
                <p>Yes and no. Did we imagine that people would do bad things on the web? Absolutely. From very early on, we knew that if it’s a powerful technology, then it’s going to be used for good and bad, just like all other powerful technologies. But initially our feeling philosophically was that the web should be a neutral medium. It’s not for the web to try to correct humanity. The web would hopefully lead to humanity becoming more connected, and therefore, maybe more sympathetic to itself — and therefore, perhaps less conflict-ridden. That was our hope. But in general, we expected day-to-day life on the web to be like day-to-day life on the street, to have its rough edges and its smooth edges.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="time">
                <p>So what has come as a surprise, then, in the past 30 years?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timBernersLee">
                <p>For the first 20 years, when people told me, “Tim, I’ve seen this web thing of yours. And I found some really bad stuff on it,” I would say, “the way the web works is you don’t follow those links. If those links lead you to garbage, don’t go there again.” So we lived in this world in which right-thinking individuals would be careful about what they looked at on the web. <br>

                    <br> But then there was suddenly the era of the Trump and Brexit votes. Not the results of the elections themselves. But at that point people looked at the way the elections were happening, and realized that people were believing things on the web, which were really pretty bizarre. The web kind of pandered to them, because it allowed them to create groups of people who believed the conspiracy theory, those groups would be as socially powerful as the groups of people who believed scientifically true facts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="time">
                <p>Was that a turning point?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timBernersLee">
                <p>Yeah, that was a turning point. We suddenly realized, actually, we have to make sure that the web is serving humanity. Not just by just keeping it free and open, but making sure that the things that people build in this permissionless space are actually helping democracy.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    
        <footer style="z-index: 8">
            <p>I think we can all agree, Tim aced it. Thanks Tim</p>
